# Monthly-Transaction

I was asked to create a data report that contains data on the progress of transactions from agents. The data consists of: 
- The number of monthly transactions or Total MTA
- The number of new users or new MTA
- The number of users who make transactions again after not making transactions for the past month or resurrected MTA
- The number of users who have not made transactions or churn MTA
- The number of users who make transactions again or or retained MTA.

Research Background :

The ability to understand and evaluate user transaction behavior is critical for driving sustainable business growth, particularly in roles focusing on data and growth analysis. Monthly transaction analysis provides key insights into user engagement, retention patterns, and overall transaction performance. Organizations needs report to make informed decisions.
